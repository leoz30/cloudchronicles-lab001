Alright, picture this: the us-central1 region just went down. Apps are failing, databases aren’t responding, and storage is stuck in limbo. Not ideal. But here’s how we get everything back online ASAP and keep downtime to a minimum.

What’s the game plan?
Cloud SQL failover – We’ve got cross-region replicas already set up in us-east1 and us-west1. The moment our primary database crashes, we promote a replica to take over instantly. Connections update, apps reroute, and we’re back in business.

Multi-region Cloud Storage backup – No one wants missing files, so we store everything critical in multi-region Cloud Storage (think northamerica-multi-region). This means data stays accessible, even if one region goes down. Object versioning helps prevent data loss.

Pub/Sub alerts & monitoring – Before anyone even notices the outage, we’ve got automated Pub/Sub alerts firing off notifications to the Ops team. Google Cloud Monitoring & Logging kicks in, tracking recovery, so we don’t just fix the issue—we learn from it.

The result?
Zero headaches for users. Their data is safe, and services are running smoothly.

Automatic failover keeps everything available in a healthy region.

Alerts and monitoring mean we catch problems before they turn into disasters.
