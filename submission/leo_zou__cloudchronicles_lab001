A STAR-based disaster recovery plan (Storage, Transactions, Analytics, and Recovery) for a Google Cloud us-central1 regional outage would involve designing a failover strategy using Google Cloud’s resilience features. Here’s how you can approach it:

Storage
Multi-region Cloud Storage: Ensure critical data is stored in multi-region buckets so it's accessible even if us-central1 is down.

Cloud SQL Read Replicas: Set up replicas in another region like us-east1 or us-west1 so the database can fail over seamlessly.

Transactions
Global Load Balancer: Implement a Cloud Load Balancer that redirects traffic away from the affected region.

Cloud SQL Failover Instance: If using Cloud SQL, configure an automatic failover instance in a different region.

Analytics
BigQuery Multi-region Dataset: Store analytics data in a multi-region dataset to ensure queries remain available.

Pub/Sub Alerts & Logging: Use Pub/Sub to publish outage alerts and track logs with Cloud Monitoring.

Recovery
Failover Activation:

Cloud SQL automatically promotes a read replica to primary.

Cloud Load Balancer reroutes traffic to healthy regions.

Multi-region storage ensures object availability.

Service Restoration:

Ensure Cloud Functions or Cloud Run services have backups in another region.

Restart affected instances after us-central1 is back online.
